# Incident description

A small healthcare clinic specializing in primary care services in the United States experienced a **security incident on a Tuesday morning around 9:00 a.m**. **Several employees reported being unable to use their computers to access files such as medical records**. Business operations were disrupted because employees were unable to access files and programs needed to perform their jobs.

In addition, employees reported the **appearance of a ransom note on their computers**. This message stated that all company files had been encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers known to target organizations in the healthcare and transportation sectors. In exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note demanded a large sum of money for the decryption key. 

**The attackers gained access to the company's network through the use of phishing emails** addressed to several company employees. These emails contained a malicious attachment that installs malware on the employee's computer once downloaded.

Once the attackers gained access, they deployed their ransomware, which encrypted critical files. **The company was unable to access critical patient data**, causing major disruptions to its business operations. The clinic had to shut down its computer systems and contact several organizations to report the incident and receive technical assistance.
